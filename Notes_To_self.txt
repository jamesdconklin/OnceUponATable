Idea for bug log -> Canvas state. sending copy of stat forces prop reload forces drawing of old state before new one. 

new idea => new object from server loses "token == this.focusObject" -> check by id instead. 

new idea - piggybacking mosueup on dragend

new idea - render before image load bug. Event handler to reload.
